# MS_Python_projects

This repo is a portfolio of my data science work using Python. It includes Python code embedded in Jupyter Notebooks and summarized outputs in html or pdf format. These projects show examples of data cleansing and munging, feature engineering, classification and regression modeling and visualization techniques.

Credit default rates (Credit One files) were analyzed using EDA techniques and modeling and was completed in Jupyter Notebook using Python.

The radmodel file is a Jupyter Notebook using Python to visualize solar radiation observations over time, and a few models to predict solar radiation values based on weather conditions.

The combined cycle plant uses Python with Jupyter Notebook to create histograms and develop a few regression models to predict energy output based on a small number of variables.

I was recently turned on to the problem of calculating Collatz number strings, so I created some code to loop through a sequence of numbers, apply the recursive Collatz calculation to each input number and calculate the length of the resulting string. The final piece is to determine the number that resulted in the longest length. The example posted calculates for numbers up to one million.
