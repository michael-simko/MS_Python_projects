# MS_Python_projects

This repo is a portfolio of my data science work using Pyhton. It includes Python code embedded in Jupyter Notebooks and summarized outputs in html or pdf format. These projects show examples of data cleansing and munging, feature engineering, classification and regression modeling and visualization techniques.

Credit default rates (Credit One files) were analyzed using EDA techniques and modeling and was acompleted in Jupyter Notebook using Python.

The radmodel file is a Jupyter Notebook using Python to visualize solar radiation observations over time, and a few models to predict solar radiation values based on weather conditions.
